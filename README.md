Start learning unity3D on my own. Sharing my demos and some experiences.



## First Day of Development: 2023.9.10

My learning plan is to find a project and then follow tutorials to learn how to use Unity3D directly. However, there is a downside to this approach. I know almost nothing about Unity3D, so I could encounter countless problems at every step. Progress is relatively slow. Today, it took me nearly three hours to achieve background importing, sunlight creation, and the functionality to generate sunlight randomly. I encountered several main issues:

1. What do the various parameters of the Camera represent?

2. What are the specific usage methods and scenarios for Canvas?
3. Does Text Legacy only serve to display text?
4. How do I add a custom layer priority to a Layer?
5. What is transform.position, and which object's position value does it refer to in the project?
6. This is something I discovered after searching for a bug for half an hour: when you drag a material into Unity3D's SampleScene, it becomes a separate entity from the source file. So, when accessing instances and prefabs in the code, you are referencing the source file. Therefore, if you don't bind the script to the source file of the game object but to an object in the game scene, the code won't be able to access the properties of the game object.

## Development Day 2ï¼š2023.9.10

After paying attention to the issues from yesterday, today's progress is much smoother. I've learned some methods for using Animation in Unity3D, although it took some effort to get the hang of it. I encountered the following main issues:

1. What kind of data type is **IEnumerator** in C#?

2. The biggest time-waster today was when I attached an event to one frame of the animation. This event kept triggering twice. It wasn't until later that I realized when I set "Use Transitions" to "Yes," it would play both animations again at the end of the first animation and the start of the second animation, causing that one frame to be played twice and triggering the event twice. It's quite puzzling.
